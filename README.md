### Automate Your Setup Workflow

- Our Scripts Tool provides a collection of ``Curl/Wget`` scripts to streamline the setup process for Debian/RPM-based systems.
- Save time and effort by automating common tasks.

### How to Use

To use the scripts, simply copy the relevant Curl or Wget command and run it in your terminal. The scripts will automatically handle the setup process for you.

For example, to update your system, run the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://sanjay7178.github.io/scripts/run.sh | bash

```

Make sure to review the script contents before running them to ensure they meet your specific requirements.
